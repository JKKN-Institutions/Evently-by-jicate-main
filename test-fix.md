# Fix Applied for Predefined Tickets Loading Issue

## Problem Identified
The predefined tickets page was getting stuck in an infinite loading state because:
1. Database queries were timing out without proper error handling
2. The `Promise.race` implementation was throwing errors instead of resolving
3. No maximum timeout was set for the entire loading process

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed Promise.race Implementation in `loadEvents()`
- Changed from rejecting on timeout to resolving with an error object
- Added 3-second timeout for database queries
- Properly handles timeout cases without blocking the page

### 2. Fixed Promise.race Implementation in `loadTickets()`
- Same timeout mechanism as events
- Graceful error handling for missing tables
- Shows user-friendly error messages

### 3. Added Maximum Loading Timeout
- 5-second maximum timeout for the entire loading process
- Forces the page to render even if queries are still pending
- Prevents infinite loading states

### 4. Improved Loading State UI
- Added informative messages during loading
- Shows that the page will load anyway if it takes too long

## Testing the Fix
1. The page should now load within 5 seconds maximum
2. If database queries timeout, the page still renders with empty data
3. Error messages are shown but don't block the UI
4. Users can still use the upload and template creation features

## Key Changes
- `loadEvents()`: Now uses proper timeout with resolve instead of reject
- `loadTickets()`: Same timeout mechanism applied
- `useEffect` hook: Added 5-second maximum loading timeout
- Loading UI: Added helpful messages for users

The page should now be accessible even when the database is slow or unavailable.
